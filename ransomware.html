	<h1>RANSOMWARE</h1>

		<p><strong>What Is Ransomware?</strong><br><br>

		Ransomware is a form of malware. Cybercriminals use ransomware as a tool to steal data and essentially hold it hostage. 
		They only release the data when they receive a ransom payment. Organizations most vulnerable to ransomware attacks hold sensitive data, 
		such as personal information, financial data, and intellectual property.<br><br> 

		Ransomware dates back to the 1980s but did not become widespread news until the early 2000s. Today, ransomware attacks are the third-most 
		used cyberattack method, accounting for over 10% of all data breaches. The emergence of cryptocurrency made ransomware even more appealing, 
		as it simplifies the ransom payment.<br><br> 

		Technology plays a big role in ransomware, as cybercriminals continually advance their methods to 
		quickly gain access and encrypt data. More companies are digitalizing, partly due to COVID restrictions and precautions. As such, more data is 
		available in remote settings than ever before.<br><br> 

		Ransomware is here to stay, so keep reading to learn how your organization 
		can reduce ransomware risk.<br><br>
		
		<strong>The Evolution of Ransomware</strong><br><br>

		Ransomware technology was first developed by a Harvard-trained evolutionary biologist by the name of Joseph L. Popp. He launched the AIDS Trojan 
		by giving diskettes infected with ransomware to attendees of an international AIDS conference held by the World Health Organization in Stockholm, Sweden. The code 
		hid file directories on their computers and demanded $189 be sent to Panama to free up their computers.<br><br>
		
		Even though the risk of ransomware has come a long way since then, its primary mission remains the same: to extort or scam money from unsuspecting users. 
		It evolved from existing on a diskette to traveling across the internet, through emails, sound, and video downloads and even inside images. In recent years, it has been a 
		tool for cryptominers, who need computing power to generate cryptocurrencies. Because mining digital assets requires a lot of expensive electricity, ransomware has been developed 
		to force a user’s computer to mine crypto all for the benefit of a cryptominer hundreds or thousands of miles away.<br><br>

		<strong>How Does Ransomware Work?</strong><br><br>

		Firmware updates enable hardware devices to continue operating efficiently and securely. These updates typically involve some form of program alteration that fixes a 
		known bug or patches against specific vulnerabilities.<br><br>
		
		Regardless of the ransomware definition, once it enters your computer, it secretly infects it. The software then proceeds to attack files and access and alter credentials 
		without the user being able to tell. As a result, the computer infrastructure is effectively held hostage by the person who controls the malware.<br><br>

		<strong>1.File Encryption</strong> - Ransomware known as cryptoware encrypts the files of the victim’s work or personal computer. This makes it so the computer’s owner cannot search for or 
		access these files unless they pay a ransom to the attacker. The attacker is the only one who can access the files because they are hidden behind the encryption password. Sometimes, the 
		attacker will lock out the entire computer and then demand a ransom before releasing the new password.<br><br>

		With leakware and doxware, the attacker threatens to publish sensitive information on the victim’s hard drive if they do not pay a ransom. Companies with private proprietary information 
		like patents and sensitive schematics may find themselves a favorite target of leakware and doxware.<br><br>

		<strong>2.Ransom and Demands</strong> - Hackers tend to ask for payment settlements using methods such as Western Union or through a text message. This helps them hide their identity. 
		Once they have the money, they decrypt the files and free up the system. Some demand bitcoin ransomware settlements due to their anonymity and a lack of a middleman.<br><br>

		Keep in mind that some attackers masquerade as U.S. law enforcement or government officials. They may say they are shutting down the victim’s computer because pornography or pirated 
		software was found on it. They then demand the victim pay a “fine” before they release their computer.<br><br>

		<strong>Types of Ransomware</strong><br><br>

		Sadly, it is cheap and easy for cyber criminals to get started with these attacks. The software solutions are inexpensive and readily available on the dark web, and some of the more 
		recent ransomware attacks have been executed using malware that is cheap and easy to find. There are several different types of ransomware, and here are some of the most popular 
		ransomware examples:<br><br>

		<strong>1. Scareware</strong><br><br>

		Scareware is a type of malware that uses social engineering to scare, shock, or cause a victim anxiety. The person is then manipulated into purchasing software they do not need. 
		Scareware often tells the victim they have been exposed to a fake virus or even another type of malware. The best way to avoid scareware is to second-guess any claims that your 
		computer has been infected unless they come from a renowned, trusted virus protection service.<br><br>

		<strong>2. Screen Locking</strong><br><br>
		Screen lockers lock your computer screen, making it seem impossible to access. Instead of your normal screen, you may get a message that demands payment before you are allowed to 
		access your screen again. It may be from a fake law enforcement agency asking you to use an online payment service to send someone money. If you have been infected by a screen locker, 
		authorities advise to not pay the ransom. You can use a recent backup to restore your computer after wiping your system.<br><br>

		<strong>3. Encrypting Ransomware</strong><br><br>
		Encrypting ransomware uses advanced encryption algorithms to encrypt the data on your device. You are given a note that explains how much you have to pay and the steps you have to take 
		to regain access to your files. Similar to screen lockers, you may have to resort to a recent backup to get your computer functioning again without giving in to the attacker’s demands.<br><br>

		<strong>4. Some Emerging Threats</strong><br><br>
		Ransomware threats are constantly evolving and growing more severe. As new security measures arise, hackers are devising more and more ways to invade the computers of individuals and 
		enterprises. Threats such as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) are becoming more and more common. With RaaS, someone can purchase or rent a full ransomware package that they can unleash on 
		anyone they want. Sometimes, they split the profits with the RaaS provider.<br><br>

		Although the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) acts against attackers, government agencies will still continue to be the targets of attacks. When a hacker is able to shut down even a small 
		branch of government—whether local or national—it affects the lives of a wide swath of people, which makes it particularly tempting to pay the ransom and get back up and running.<br><br></p>
